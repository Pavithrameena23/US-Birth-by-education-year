📌 Project Overview
This project examines the shifting landscape of United States births over a pivotal six-year period. Using Tableau, I processed multi-year census-style data to uncover patterns in birth rates, maternal demographics, and regional variances. The dashboard provides a clear visualization of how national birth trends have evolved, offering insights into population growth and healthcare planning requirements.

📊 Key Insights
Temporal Trends: Identified year-over-year fluctuations in birth rates, highlighting the specific impact of socio-economic factors on family planning between 2016 and 2021.

Maternal Demographics: Analyzed birth distribution across different maternal age groups, identifying shifts toward later-in-life parenthood trends.

Regional Hotspots: Mapped birth density across US states to pinpoint regions with the highest growth, essential for infrastructure and school district planning.

Birth Characteristics: Explored data related to birth settings and methods, providing a lens into the modern American healthcare experience.

🛠️ Technical Toolkit
Time-Series Visualization: Developed complex line charts and area graphs to track demographic changes across multiple years.

Geospatial Mapping: Utilized Tableau's mapping capabilities to show birth density at the state level.

Advanced Filtering: Implemented multi-select filters for Year, State, and Demographic categories to allow for granular "drill-down" analysis.

Data Normalization: Calculated percentage changes and growth rates to ensure an "apples-to-apples" comparison across different population sizes.
